<InfinityMainLayout title="Lore" description="The Maiming of a Sorcerer — the original backstory of Infinity MUD. Discover how a vengeful sorcerer's village was transported to another dimension.">
  <PageHeader title="Infinity Theme Story">
    What follows is a short story that was designed to explain how Infinity came
    to be, and why the town looks much like Los Angeles did after the riots. It
    hasn't been released to the general public before the creation of Infinity's
    home pages, so consider yourself treated to something secret....also keep in
    mind that this is pretty raw, and was kept out of the public eye for a
    reason.

  <PageSection title="THE MAIMING OF A SORCERER">
    Back in the time of the Stone Wars, there lived a being of great power,
    known only as The Sorcerer. Such designations seem common, perhaps even
    uninventive, until one realizes that the power behind a name is a power
    beyond imagining, when dealing with magical creatures.
  </PageSection>

  <PageSection>
    The life of a Sorcerer is a lonely life indeed, and the creatures one may
    summon from the depths of the Netherworlds are usually not chosen for their
    conversational abilities. And thus the Sorcerer chose to live on Earth
    itself, among humans. He fashioned a tower from rocks hewn of quarries of
    marble, supporting walls of marble with pillars of foreign metal, and made
    it his home.
  </PageSection>

  <PageSection>
    Powerful entities frequently are held in contempt by the commoners of the
    land. It is expected, one supposes, that over the period of several
    centuries the villagers got restless. Led by a villager named Breltain, 40
    men armed with iron tools stormed the gates of the Tower and entered, intent
    on slaying The Sorcerer.
  </PageSection>

  <PageSection>
    Iron weapons clashed against mystical forces for a few short hours. The
    Sorcerer was a skilled user of magic; the iron in the villagers weapons
    enabled them to batter down walls of sheer force, slice through barriers of
    fire. Combat ensued between the villagers and creatures of evil origins,
    summoned in a last-ditch attempt by the Sorcerer to protect his home and his
    soul.
  </PageSection>

  <PageSection>
    Human-wrought iron is impure, though, and although the determination of the
    villagers was strong, the combined might of Darkslayers and Soulstealers
    made short work of their lives. Breltain alone made it to the top of the
    Tower, and hacked down the door to gain entrance to the inner sanctum of the
    Sorcerer. The Sorcerer's defenses were weakened by emergency attempts at
    summoning creatures, and with Breltain battered and bruised, the two locked
    themselves in mortal combat, each pitting the last of their strength against
    their opponent.
  </PageSection>

  <PageSection>
    Magic failed to respond to The Sorcerer's command, and Breltain could not
    summon the strength to defeat his opponent in a single blow. Grappling for a
    few short moments, the two combatants unleashed their raw emotions on each
    other, amid the burning remains of the Tower of the Sorcerer. With his last
    breath, Breltain swung the axe at the Sorcerer's head, slicing out his left
    eye with the blade. Among the puddle of blood and internal fluids lay the
    Sorcerer, his defenses weakened, eye burst, vision and power halved.
  </PageSection>

  <PageSection>
    It can be said to the Sorcerer's credit that when he was approached by the
    Darker Forces of Magic, he was both too distraught over the attack, and
    angry at the loss of his eye to stand against the evil being offered him.
  </PageSection>

  <PageSection>
    Yet embrace the power he did, and with power came mastery over anatomy. His
    left eye drained completely, and was replaced with a diamond, able to see
    far distances, and able to see past clouding spells of sorcery cast against
    him. With the aid of evil minions, the Tower was rebuilt, and the power of
    the Sorcerer grew. As his final rebuilding task, he commanded Darkslayers
    and Soulstealers to ravage the village that had attacked him. Bodies were
    strewn across the streets like toys, and many people had their left eye
    plucked out. Screams echoed through the buildings as the entire village was
    ripped from the land, and placed in a dimension without sight, without
    sound, and without purpose. Lost between time zones, and in a different
    place, the villagers were left. Lost in the place known only as Infinity.
  </PageSection>

  <PageSection>
    Few actions of this magnitude can come to pass without an equal and opposite
    reaction occuring, though. From the netherworld were spawned ArchWizards of
    fantastic power, capable of creating objects from nothing, and created for
    themselves the duty of righting this wrong.
  </PageSection>

  <PageSection>
    Due to the natural laws of the Universe, these ArchWizards were unable to
    affect the situation directly. For each attempt they made to remove the
    Sorcerer, he unleashed terrific powers against them, preventing them from
    killing the Sorcerer, and from removing the village from Infinity.
  </PageSection>

  <PageSection>
    Indirect actions worked well, though, and repeated attempts at creating a
    champion from outside the dimension resulted in many adventurers being
    trapped within the village. With their vast powers of creation and
    manipulation of the surroundings, they endeavored to create a way for select
    adventurers to battle the Sorcerer, and undermine his position.
  </PageSection>

  <PageSection>
    The final culmination of their efforts was to create training areas for the
    adventurers. The remaining villagers joined in the effort, hosting pubs,
    trading centers, and providing religious aid for those willing to face the
    horrors of the Sorcerer. The ArchWizards enlisted the aid of other creating
    Wizards to form areas for the adventurers to fight in, hone their reasoning
    skills, and test their ability to solve puzzles. All in preparation for the
    final battle against the Sorcerer.
  </PageSection>

  <PageSection>
    And thus the story comes to an end. Locked in an eternal battle against The
    Sorcerer, adventurers pit their skills and abilities against wizard-wrought
    challenges, while the Sorcerer continues to ravage the village in it's
    time-lost location. Legend has it that every once in a while, one lone
    adventurer discovers the weakness of The Sorcerer, and frees the village. As
    it always has been, it depends on the adventurer to make the legend live.
