  <h3 class="text-center text-xl">THEY'RE NEVER SATISFIED</h3>

  <p class="text-center text-lg italic mb-1">by Dave Lebling</p><p>
    I had my first encounter with a professional play-tester two years ago, when
    I was writing <span class="italic">Starcross</span>. As I worked, every so
    often my concentration would be broken by a horrible cackling laugh from a
    few doors down the hall. Jerry had found another bug.
  </p>

  <span class="font-bold">Infocom</span>'s Quality Control Department
  (informally, play-testers) makes sure our stories are bug-free before they get
  published. From the first, horrifically buggy version "thrown in the swimming
  pool," to the final, perfect (hah!) version that we ship, the play-testers
  pound away, searching for flaws. It starts out very simply. Let's take <i
    >Suspect</i
  > for a victim ... oops, I mean an example. When a game first enters testing, it's
  a delicate thing, easily upset:
  <pre>
    > BARTENDER, GIVE ME A DRINK
    "Sorry, I've been hired to mix drinks and that's all."
    
    > DANCE WITH ALICIA
    Which Alicia do you mean, Alicia or the overcoat?
    
    Veronica's body is slumped behind the desk, strangled with a lariat.
    
    > TALK TO VERONICA
    Veronica's body is listening.
    </pre>

  Little bugs, you know? Things no one would notice. At this point the tester's
  job is fairly easy. The story is like a house of cards -- it looks pretty
  solid but the slightest touch collapses it:
  <pre>
    Media Room
    > ENTER
    **FATAL ERROR: Pushdown Overflow**
    </pre>

  Mysteries have a lot of scope for truly odd bugs, since they have so many
  characters running around. Throughout the testing process, I would get reports
  like:
  <pre>
    "Duffy is having serious problems .... "
    "Alicia isn't functioning too well .... "
    "The detective seems stuck in the North Hallway .... "
    </pre>

  <i>Suspect</i> has thirteen characters (counting you) and a few bit players, so
  at times it resembled a Marx brothers movie. Testers are relentless. Once they
  find out they can talk to a corpse, you can confidently expect a list of all the
  other things that will listen to them: cars, tables, chairs, waste baskets, anything.
  This is sometimes called "rubbing it in." They had a particularly gleeful time
  with poor Veronica's body. It's not enough that she's been murdered. No, first
  they decide to hide the body. Then, to make things worse, they carry her around,
  presumably slung over the shoulder.
  <pre>
    
    > SHOW CORPSE TO MICHAEL
    Michael doesn't appear interested.
    </pre>

  Of course, Michael is only Veronica's husband; why would he be interested?
  After that, it was open season! Bodies everywhere:
  <pre>
    "I carried Veronica's body into the Ballroom.  No one noticed."
    "Sergeant Duffy walked right by while I was carrying the body.
    He didn't notice it."
    "I put the body in the chair in the Library.
    Col. Marston came and went without seeing it."
    "I picked up the body right in front of the detective. "
    </pre>

  That wasn't enough:
  <pre>
    > THROW CORPSE IN FIREPLACE
    Veronica's body is now in the fireplace.
    
    > ATTACK CORPSE WITH CROWBAR
    Veronica's body jumps out of the way.
    </pre>

  Eventually, that all got sorted out: Veronica stayed safely dead, and her
  party guests got less blase about corpses. Producing a piece of interactive
  fiction is an odd combination of debugging a program and writing a story. Bug
  reports can concern anything from a stack overflow to a misplaced comma. There
  was a running battle (finally settled by Fowler's <i>English Usage</i>) over
  when a comma goes inside a quotation mark and when outside. By the same token,
  bugs can concern something as microcomputer-oriented as the stack size on the
  Atari implementation of the story. Some comments from testers would not be out
  of place in a report from an editor at a major book publisher:
  <pre>
    "Alicia is acting out of character." 
    "Why would Michael react that way when told about the murder?"
    "Ostmann's motivations seem too obscure."
    </pre>

  Some comments are directly keyed off of programming bugs that would make a
  BASIC programmer blush:
  <pre>
    "Game prints garbage when Duffy enters room."
    "You can drop Veronica's pulse on the floor."
    </pre>

  There are several stages in implementing one of our stories. During the first
  stage, the author is so pleased that it works at all that any bug reports are
  welcomed. During this stage the typical bug concerns two rooms that connect in
  only one direction (you can go east from the first to the second but there is
  no way to go back). During the second stage, all of the testers and several
  other game authors have had a chance to play it, and the really nasty comments
  come in. During this stage, bugs cause serious changes in the plot, and
  sub-plots are added or removed. This is when "debugging" is more like writing
  another draft of a novel than debugging a program. The plot is hardened into
  its final form, and outside testers are given their first crack at the story.
  Finally comes the stage in which every bug is seen by the author as an
  imposition. I can always tell when a story is almost finished by my rising
  level of frustration at seeing new bugs in my mailbox. At some point, coming
  to the office in the morning becomes an exercise in procrastination. You see,
  at <b>Infocom</b>
  there is a hall with all the mailboxes in it, and you have to walk past the mailboxes
  to get to the coffee machine. The question becomes, "How much do I really want
  my first cup of coffee this morning?" You can always avert your eyes as you walk
  by the mailboxes, but that's almost too obvious. Better is to make a casual appraisal
  as you walk by. "Hmm. Looks like a fairly small stack this morning...." Then you
  can walk to the coffee machine with a clear conscience. Even a cup of yummy coffee
  won't improve things when you see "page 1 of 12" on the first bug report form.
  Amazingly enough, it all works out in the end. Sometimes a full-page bug report
  will turn out to be caused by a simple little error, and you can check off three
  or four subsidiary bugs with one stroke. Sometimes a simple little thing you've
  glossed over three times as unimportant will be re-reported, and you realize it's
  more like the last six inches of a dragon's tail. Best of all are the final few
  days before a story is shipped, when the volume of bugs drops to almost zero, and
  you realize that even the testers are reaching for things to report. Then, at long
  last you look in your mailbox and nothing's there! You say hello to the testers
  in the halls without terror, and there's nothing whatsoever to worry about. Until
  the next game!
