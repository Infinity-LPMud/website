  <PageSection title="Lost in the Enchanted Realm">
    It appears you've stumbled upon an ancient pathway that leads to realms
    untold. Alas, the enchantment seems to have taken a mischievous turn, and
    you find yourself in the midst of a 404 error - a portal lost in the echoes
    of the fantasy realm.
  </PageSection>

  <PageSection title="What Might Have Transpired?">
    Perhaps a mischievous sprite cast a spell on the page you sought, whisking
    it away to a land of forgotten URLs. Or, it could be that a nasty dragon
    mistook your request for treasure and snatched it from the digital realm.
  </PageSection>

  <PageSection title="Fear Not, Adventurer!">
    While your desired page may be concealed in the shadows, you're not alone.
    Navigate the stars, use the ancient browser refresh potion, or try retracing
    your steps through the forest of hyperlinks. The spirits of the digital
    realm are known to guide those with a steadfast heart.

  <PageSection title="A Word from the Elders:">
    "In the digital tapestry of the internet, lost pages are but a small ripple.
    Seek, explore, and you shall find your way back to the realms of
    information."
  </PageSection>

  <PageSection title="The Fellowship of Developers">
    If your quest proves futile, send a raven (or an email) to the wise
    Archwizards. They possess the ancient scrolls of coding and may be able to
    conjure a solution to your digital conundrum.
