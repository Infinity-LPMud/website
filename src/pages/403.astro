  <PageSection title="A Barrier to the Realm">
    It seems you've approached a forbidden door, one that the guardians of this
    realm have sealed. The path you seek lies beyond the reach of those
    uninvited.
  </PageSection>

  <PageSection title="Why This Gate is Closed">
    Perhaps the ancient wards of protection have been placed around this portal
    to prevent unauthorized access. Or, the spirits of the realm have deemed you
    unworthy to cross its threshold at this moment.
  </PageSection>

  <PageSection title="Do Not Worry, Brave Soul!">
    While this gate may be closed for now, the realm offers many paths for the
    worthy. Retrace your steps, seek guidance, or try a different route. The
    path to knowledge is always available to those with the courage to seek it.
  </PageSection>

  <PageSection title="A Word from the Elders:">
    "Not every door is meant to open to all. Sometimes, it is through patience
    and persistence that one finds the key to hidden knowledge."
  </PageSection>

  <PageSection title="The Fellowship of Developers">
    If you believe this gate should not be closed to you, send a raven (or an
    email) to the guardians of the realm. They may hold the key to unlocking
    this path for you.
  </PageSection>

  <PageSection title="In the Meantime...">
    While the gates are closed, feel free to visit our <a href="/">homepage</a> and
    explore the other corners of our mystical world. The adventure never truly ends.
